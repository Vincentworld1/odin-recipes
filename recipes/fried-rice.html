  <p>Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooked rice</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Vegetables</li>
    <li>Soy sauce</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the rice: Use leftover cooked rice that has been cooled for at least a few hours. This helps avoid sticky rice during stir-frying.</li>
    <li>Scramble the eggs: Heat some oil in a pan, pour the beaten eggs, and scramble them until fully cooked. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Stir-fry the vegetables: In the same pan, add a bit more oil and saut√© vegetables like peas, carrots, and green onions until they are tender-crisp.</li>
    <li>Combine rice and eggs: Add the cooked rice and scrambled eggs to the pan with the vegetables. Stir everything together to mix well.</li>
    <li>Add soy sauce and season: Pour in soy sauce and stir-fry everything together for a few minutes, adjusting seasoning to taste. Garnish with extra green onions if desired.</li>
