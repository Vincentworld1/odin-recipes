  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>fish covered with batter (= a mixture of flour, eggs and milk) and then fried and served with pieces of fried potato, often eaten in the UK as a takeaway food (= food bought at a shop or restaurant and taken home or somewhere else to eat): We took the fish and chips home and ate them straight from the paper.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fish Fillets</li>
    <li>Potatoes</li>
    <li>All-purpose Flour</li>
    <li>Beer or Water</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Fish: Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper, then dip them in flour to coat lightly.</li>
    <li>Make the Batter: In a bowl, mix all-purpose flour, cold beer or water, and a pinch of salt until smooth. The batter should be thick enough to coat the fish.</li>
    <li>Prepare the Chips: Peel and cut potatoes into thick strips. Soak them in cold water for 30 minutes, then pat dry.</li>
    <li>Fry the Fish and Chips: Heat oil in a deep fryer or a pan. Dip the fish into the batter and fry until golden brown. Fry the chips until crispy.</li>
    <li>Serve and Enjoy: Drain excess oil from both the fish and chips, then serve hot with tartar sauce or malt vinegar.</li>
  </ol>
